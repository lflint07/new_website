                  My career has definitely taken an untraditional trajectory. I
                  graduated from Virginia Tech in 2011 with a business degree in
                  hospitality during one of the largest economic downturns in
                  modern history. Despite this, I began finding opportunities
                  wherever they presented themselves. This helped me gain
                  insightful experience and a plethora of applicable skills in
                  several industries before eventually deciding to move to
                  Charlotte.

                <p>
                  I’m all about going where the opportunity is, and Charlotte is
                  a hub for talented minds. After establishing myself here, I
                  found my next opportunity in completing the full-stack web
                  development bootcamp with Tech Talent South. I worked in a
                  series of creative roles for two Charlotte-based startups
                  before finding my way to 2ULaundry, a pickup-and-delivery
                  laundry startup.

                  Some say this was my Cinderella Story as I started as a
                  delivery driver and quickly moved up in the ranks. After
                  identifying large customer service improvements, the creating
                  two separate positions for me within the Customer Care Team:
                  Tier II Analyst and Senior Business Analyst, respectively. I
                  worked with that team to develop and implement processes to
                  enhance overall employee and customer experience. I then
                  joined the Research and Development team, where I maintained
                  internal systems, managed projects, and aggregated data for
                  reporting.

                <p>
                  Due to COVID-19, however, the company downsized and I was laid
                  off and I’ve definitely come full circle. Now, I’m looking to
                  utilize my skills with a technology-forward company as a web
                  developer, designer or project manager while building
                  customer-centric, front-end technology.
